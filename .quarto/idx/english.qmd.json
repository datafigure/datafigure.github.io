We can also offer one-on-one mentoring, expert opinions, organizational consulting, and project-based work.\nFor training sessions, both the format and level are flexible—we have organized events ranging from 30-minute talks to multi-day workshops, catering to both beginners and advanced professionals. These have taken place as part of conferences, in online training series, or as standalone on-site courses. Our clients include private and public sector organizations, schools, universities, government institutions, and NGOs, both in Estonia and across Europe.\n\nEach session is customized based on client needs, and materials are regularly updated, as AI and related technologies evolve rapidly. Typically, no two training sessions are exactly the same. We provide training in both Estonian and English. Below is a summary of workshop formats and topics so far, but custom themes can easily be incorporated within the broad area of AI and digital skills.\n\n- Workshops on AI and its applications in education, organizations, and data analytics. Our training covers generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Elicit, and Canva), AI-assisted automation, and the use of large language models for data analysis. Depending on the audience, the focus can be on education, practical workplace applications, or automation solutions.\n- Introductory programming workshops in R, focusing on data visualization and data wrangling, particularly for non-programmers in fields such as humanities and social sciences.\n- Hackathons, often in combination with preparatory training. These events can include topic introductions, dataset preparation, team mentoring, and technical support.\n- If our expertise and your interests align, we are happy to customize a course, workshop, or hackathon to fit your learning goals, data, and interests.
